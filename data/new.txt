Foreon is a decentralized prediction market built on the Cardano blockchain, aiming to offer a secure, transparent, and accessible platform for users to make predictions and trade on event outcomes, addressing the shortcomings of traditional prediction markets by harnessing blockchain technology and the stable infrastructure of Cardano to provide a fair and open environment for users.

The Foreon Network Litepaper, authored by Foreon Technologies, outlines the vision for a decentralized prediction protocol on the Cardano blockchain, though it's important to note that this document is a working version and not the final iteration of the Foreon Network whitepaper, dated 20th July 2023.

The Foreon Network Litepaper, dated 20th July 2023, provides an overview of the platform's objectives, features, technical approach, smart contracts, token details, and roadmap. It outlines the platform's mission to offer a decentralized prediction protocol on the Cardano blockchain, emphasizing transparency, security, efficiency, and accessibility while incentivizing user engagement through rewards and community-driven governance. The technical approach includes the use of Cardano's eUTXO model and Plutus Smart Contracts, with the Djed stablecoin as a secure trading currency. The basic interaction flow illustrates how users can create, participate, and earn from prediction markets while Foreon Network earns a 2.5% commission as a fee. The Foreon Network token, $FRN, has a well-designed tokenomics plan with strategic allocations, vesting schedules, and utilities to enhance value and community involvement. It will serve as a governance tool, rewarding mechanism, collateral, and will undergo buybacks to boost demand. The roadmap outlines the project's progress, including the mainnet launch, partnerships, and governance development, aiming for a successful and transparent future.


Foreon is preparing to launch its Initial Stakepool Offering (ISPO), and further details will be announced soon. Stay tuned for updates and information on how to participate.

The team of Forean is led by co-founder Sven Janssen and comprises skilled individuals including Insysiengmai Somsay as the Frontend Developer, Toshi Cardanomoto as the UI Designer/Product Manager, Smith Zhang as the Smart Contract Developer, and Lekside as the Community Manager.
