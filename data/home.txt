THE HEALTH IT STANDARD: SEE HOW THOUSANDS OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES USE GOLIATH TO IMPROVE CLINICIAN EXPERIENCE

END-USER EXPERIENCE MONITORING & TROUBLESHOOTING Industry leading end-user experience monitoring and troubleshooting software, with embedded intelligence and automation, that enables IT pros to anticipate, troubleshoot, and document performance issues regardless of where workloads, applications, or users are located.


  HOW GOLIATH WORKS Goliath provides actual user experience from the end users perspective. Traditional approaches look at the independent performance of IT infrastructure and applications. This means they must infer end user experience and that causes unproductive communication and increases time to resolution.

Built for troubleshooting

Isolating the root cause has never been this easy

Goliath automatically correlates performance data from various sources across the infrastructure including hypervisors, servers, operating systems, and applications to quickly identify where a problem occurs and isolate root cause. Allowing anyone on your technical team to quickly resolve even the most complicated logon initiation, logon duration, and session performance issues.
