Why is my logon duration reported as 0 seconds?
In some cases, if the log on duration value is not returned (when querying the Citrix service via ODATA), the GPM interface will display 0 seconds as the value.

This can be misleading as the data is not available and is not in fact 0 seconds. On the next refresh when the data is available, it will be recorded and reported in the interface.

This is a known issue and will be addressed in a future release.
