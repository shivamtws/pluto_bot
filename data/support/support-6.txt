Master Agent & IIS
Are there any options from a technical stand point that can be done to accomodate a Master Agent architecture situation using an existing VM that already has IIS sites running?

No, at this point we do not support shared IIS and have encountered issues with this in the past. Master Agent, like the GPM Server, must have dedicated IIS.
