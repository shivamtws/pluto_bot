How do I determine which account is running as the GAAM Endpoint User?
As a prerequisite, the Goliath Application Availability Monitor (GAAM) Endpoint, requires a user with Windows administrative rights on the machine to be in active or disconnected state to the machine. This account is the one which initially ran the GAAMEndpoint.exe installer file. To determine which user account this is, please review the following sections.

Determine via Task Manager
Connect to the GAAM Endpoint machine as a user with Windows administrative rights to the machine.
Open Task Manager, go to the Details tab and sort by the Name column.
Confirm if there is a process named LogonSimulator.exe running.
If so, use the User name column to identify the user who is running this process, this user is the GAAM Endpoint user. 
If there is no such process running, please proceed to the next section for an alternative method of identifying the GAAM Endpoint user.
Determine via the Users Directory
Connect to the GAAM Endpoint machine as a user with Windows administrative rights to the machine.
Open Windows File Explorer and navigate to C:\Users
Access the list of users, do any of them look to be formatted as a service account? Do any of them have GAAM in their name? or GOL?
If so, go to the startup folder for those users to see if it includes LogonSimulator.exe. 
C:\Users\{{INSERT USERNAME}}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
If not, manually go to the startup folder for each user to check for the LogonSimulator.exe file
The user who contains LogonSimulator.exe is the GAAM Endpoint user.
