Why am I getting logged out?
Goliath Performance Monitor refreshes many pages and dialogs automatically, but to refresh a  page manually, use the built-in Refresh option on the page (as seen at the top of the page in the example figure, below).

If you use the browser refresh option, you will be required to log back in to the application.
