Will an expired License Key break the technology?
Question: I haven't put my new license key into the technology yet and it is running on an expired license key. Will an expired key break the technology?

Answer: When a license key expires, GPM continues to run, so the user can apply an updated license key, for example. However, all monitoring is disabled and agent connections are inhibited.
