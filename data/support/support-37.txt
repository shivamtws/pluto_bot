Why is my launch failing for VMware Horizon domain authentication?
VMware Horizon Client Domain Authentication Issues
Goliath is aware of an issue when using Goliath Application Availability Monitor in a VMware Horizon deployment where our API calls for launching a session fail surrounding Domain Authentication.

The VMware Horizon client will show: "You are not entitled to that desktop or application" while logging in manually to the VMware Horizon client with the same credentials Goliath Application Availability Monitor uses is successful.

Goliath will update this KB article as additional information becomes available.
