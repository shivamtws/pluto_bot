Does the Goliath Agent continue to gather metrics when not connected to Goliath?
When the Goliath Agent is not connected to the Goliath Server, the Goliath Agent will stop collecting metrics. In the case where the Goliath Agent loses connectivity due to network issues or Goliath Server becomes unavailable for any reason, the Goliath Agent will immediately stop collecting and it will enter a cycle to repeatedly retry to reconnect  to the Goliath Server every 20 seconds. Once the Goliath Agent is reconnected and signed-in to the Goliath Server, it will then start collecting again.
